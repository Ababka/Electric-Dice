About-

Electric Dice is a commissioned project that was designed in house,
the client is asking for a modular item that can display a chosen dice and have it “roll”.
In return it would show a random number in its range and display it.

This is still in the very early stages of development, but more ideas are unfolding and expanding the product.
Potential additions will include a touch screen display, animated feedback (either in the form of moving numbers or a short video).
